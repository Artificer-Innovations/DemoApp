### Task 9.1b: Support Renaming the Project

**Goal**: We started this project as "Demo App", "DemoApp", "demoapp" - but we want to rename it Beaker Stack.
And we would like to make it easy to rename this project to anything else, so it can be easily reused. The goal
of this task os to create tools to allow "renaming" the stack, updating any public strings or app IDs that are
string based. And to confirm that when renamed the app cleanly builds.
**Scope**:

- Audit all packages (`apps/web`, `apps/mobile`, `packages/*`) and configuration files for hard-coded project names, bundle IDs, display names, URLs, Supabase project references, and GitHub identifiers.
- Implement a reusable rename workflow (script + documentation) that accepts source and target names (e.g. camelCase, PascalCase, kebab-case) and applies consistent replacements.
- Update Expo/EAS configs, iOS bundle identifiers, Android application IDs, web metadata, Supabase config, CI/CD workflow files, and any docs that surface the project name.
- Provide guidance for regenerating platform-specific artifacts (e.g. `ios` and `android` directories if needed) after running the rename.
  **Tests**:
- Unit: Add coverage for rename utilities (e.g. casing transforms, dry-run validation, detection of missing replacements).
- Manual: Use the rename command to switch the stack from “Beaker Stack” to a new sample name, rebuild all apps (`web`, `mobile`, backend services if applicable), and verify clean builds and correct naming in app metadata.

**Deliverables**:

- A Node script (e.g. `scripts/rename-project.mjs`) plus an accompanying npm script (`npm run rename -- --from "Demo App" --to "Beaker Stack"`).
- Updated configuration files reflecting the new project name defaults.
- Documentation in `TASKS.md` or a dedicated `docs/renaming.md` describing supported cases, required follow-up steps, and any limitations.

- Web deployment automation (`scripts/pr-preview/deploy-web.sh`) targeting the preview S3/CloudFront resources

## Testing Strategy for Each Task

### Unit Tests

Each task should include unit tests that:

- Test the specific functionality in isolation
- Use mocks for external dependencies
- Have clear test cases for success and failure scenarios
- Run quickly (< 1 second per test)

### Manual Tests

Each task should include manual tests that:

- Can be run from command line or browser
- Verify the functionality works end-to-end
- Include steps to reproduce the test
- Have clear success/failure criteria

### Integration Tests

Tasks that involve multiple systems should include:

- Tests that verify components work together
- Database integration tests where applicable
- Cross-platform functionality tests
- Real API calls where appropriate

## Success Criteria

Each task is considered complete when:

1. ✅ All unit tests pass
2. ✅ All manual tests pass
3. ✅ Code follows project standards (linting, formatting)
4. ✅ TypeScript compilation succeeds
5. ✅ Documentation is updated if needed
6. ✅ Task deliverables are implemented and working

## Dependencies

Tasks should be completed in order, as later tasks depend on earlier ones:

- Phase 1 (Foundation) must be completed before any other phases
- Phase 2 (Database) must be completed before Phase 3 (Auth)
- Phase 3 (Auth) must be completed before Phase 4 (Profile)
- And so on...

## Estimated Timeline

- **Phase 1-2**: 2-3 days (Foundation & Database)
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 days (Authentication)
- **Phase 4**: 2-3 days (Profile Management)
- **Phase 5**: 2-3 days (Platform Screens)
- **Phase 6**: 2-3 days (Avatar Upload)
- **Phase 7**: 2-3 days (Testing)
- **Phase 8**: 1-2 days (Scripts & Tooling)
- **Phase 9**: 2-3 days (CI/CD)
- **Phase 10**: 1-2 days (Documentation)

**Total Estimated Time**: 17-26 days

This timeline assumes working on one task at a time with proper testing between each task.
